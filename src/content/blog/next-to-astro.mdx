## Motivation

In April 2022, I have decided to remove JavaScript from my own personal website
(yes, the one you're on right now). This does not mean I had to not use a single
line of the web programming language, but that I had to make my website work
without the need of a client-side, SPA framework. A few reasons might come in
mind for this:

<ReasonList title="Why use server-side web frameworks?" items={[
  "Reducing client load time by not loading a rendering framework",
  "Reducing data usage by sending as little as possible",
  "Making a website instead of a web app",
  "Making a website that can function without JavaScript",
  "Reducing development chores by removing dependencies"
]} />

At that point, I knew I had to either use a tried and tested static generator or
cutting edge web frameworks. I couldn't find the first option very welcoming, as
I was aware that the classig SSG approach involved either using programming
languages different from JavaScript or templating engines with their own syntax
and, for all its worth and React controversy, JSX feels pretty natural right now.

## The experiment

So I looked into the second solution. But while I was only learning to navigate
the [Deno](https://deno.land/) ü¶ï space, I wasn't ready to jump ship into the
complete unknown in production (no harm meant for Deno, I think it's great and
has the potential of being a major part in the ecosystem, through its security
and compatibility with the browser). That left me with going to the extreme
landscape edge, straight to [Remix](https://remix.run),
[Marko](https://markojs.com) or [Astro](https://astro.build), all which I
thought could cover my needs and more. I have to be honest, I actually got on
the Remix hype train, gave it a try, experimenteed locally and ... didn't get it.
It felt unpolished, over-engineered (yes, a hot take) and very capable of
amazing things ... in the future. For me, and especially for this endless
blog-like project, this was not needed. What I actually wanted was not a
hyperactive edge server, but:

1. Static file serving
2. Build support to help me keep it DRY
3. Markdown or, even better, MDX integration with [remark](https://remark.js.org/)

So I had to let Remix go, but I promise üôè I'll come back for the next project.
I just have to test those error boundaries better (yes, I think that's a great
feature and I am aware it's in React since v16, but it wasn't promoted to its
capabilities, which Remix actually does).

I had, in my endless choice, to pick between Marko and Astro, and the third
criteria, along with the native `<Markdown />` component, made all the
difference. `Astro` is a beta-level open-source framework (it was pre-beta when
I started tinkering with it) and it feels, among others, unstable. The docs are
lately out of date, with conflicting instructions because they cover multiple
versions, and a few things are just in the plans, not in the works (like a
stable `<Image />` component that uses build-time magic and still works without
JavaScript). But enough with the negative, let's see why I actually switched.

## Welcome the new: astro.build

First of all, it has markdown, remark and components in markdown as first-class
citizens, and that is a core part of a simple blog. I just migrated my
remark-rehype plugin settings into the Astro configuration and it was haflway
ready to be used. The other half is the _second advantage_, easy Tailwind
integration (and later Tailwind as a favored integration through the
`@astrojs/tailwind`). _Third reason_, their data interpolation syntax is as
close you can get to JSX without being JSX, but wait, it gets better, you use
plain HTML attributes, so no more `className` üéâ or camel-case shenanigans. This
is actually the hardest part in the migration from NextJS to Astro: renaming the
messed up attributes in React components into normal `HTML`. Talking about that,
Astro supports components from major frontend frameworls (React, Vue, Angular,
Preact, Svelte), but I have discovered that their plain `.astro` components,
which can use build time data and have no client-side JavaScript, were all I
actually needed. And if I ever need something that is dynamic and needs state
management, I can use their island architecture and client-side loading
directives to delay the loading of any fancy framework.

That being said, the migration felt easy, but had a few hurdles. I had to let go
of the communication form whose backend was also managed by NextJS and of the
page loading animation, because pages are not loaded now, you actually navigate
to a new `HTML` document. And I had to make a decision: do I change my design
and remove the experience section tabs on the
[homepage](https://vanntile.com#section-experience) or do I integrate React on
the homepage just to use `react-tabs`? I actually did neither and wrote a fully
[accessible](http://web-accessibility.carnegiemuseums.org/code/tabs/) tabs
implementation in 60 lines. It's simple and achieves
feature parity with `react-tabs` if I use it on a single table (I won't code
in extensibility into the code unless I needed). More than this, the `<script>`
is only loaded with the component and could be bundled, if I decided to.
Finally, I added a small script that is loaded on every page to manage the
light-dark theme preference (based on my choice that dark mode should be default
on my website, but I can offer the light theme option on the blog) and another
one for the theme switcher button in the navigation bar. And that was pretty
much the transition (if I were to forget with my experiemnts with
[astro-imagetools](https://astro-imagetools-docs.vercel.app/en/introduction) and
[tailwind typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) which I
abandoned by the end).

## The results

In the end, I was completely delighted with the results. As you can see in the
[Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) comparison below, the
overall performance increased by 13 points, to 99, I shaved **200ms** from
the blocking time and halved the time-to-interactive to **1.4s**.

/>

The above are measured in the deployed versions, on the mobile test. To be
honest, part of the difference is the simultaneous transition to
[render.com](https://render.com/) from [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). But to
add some hard numbers to the above stats, the NextJS version was loading
initially `184kB (435kB of data)`, while the improved Astro version is only
`68kB (143kB data)`, which is a 65% network usage reduction. So the Lighthouse
test must be getting something out of this reduction. This is not to say that
Next is bad, but that I am not in need of their offering (although I miss their
`<Image />` component).

At the time of writing this article, Astro is at the 12th beta version and has
decided on a stable API, while launching SSR and their first hackathon for v1.0.
I currently am excited for their future and can't wait to see where this
community will end up with. The ability to integrate component frameworks seems
crucial to me, but building things in their own way will be what pushes them
forward.
