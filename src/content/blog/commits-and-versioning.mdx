## Commiting is hard!

Whether making time for taxes, organising desktop files or a relationship, commiting is hard. Oh, and also `git`.
Git is, as many of you probably already know, infinitely useful and incredibly hard to properly operate from an
organisational point of view. I know what you're thinking, just a quick `issue fix` commit won't create any problems.
But I assure you, 25 commits later, when you don't know when you did a fix or why you did commit `package.json`
modifications (yes, I am a JS developer, roast me on your favorite social media) for the third time in a row, you would
wish you had a system.

For an `npm` project, my system is described in detail below and it uses standard development packages that you might
want to consider for your own work. As a plus, now I have a standard way of commiting in any project, no matter
the technology (thanks to globally installed npm packages).

Why would you keep reading? Well, you can copy the commands and configs like in a tutorial, or at least be aware what
pitfalls are actually manageable in today's industry.

## Table of Contents

## Conventional commits

[Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) are a spec for how to write commits, which brings
advantages for everyone. Spec or no spec, as everyone starts using this properly it will get better to jump into
someone's project. It's structure is supposed to look like:

```text
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

- **type** is the most important part: it stands as a quick "tag" that you can easily scan for when you're looking at a
  commit history. As a bonus, having a solid set of tags can be used for CI/CD pipeline triggers. More on the standard
  tags (and my chosen scopes) below.
- **description** is a short text which focuses on what the change was on. There are common rules on writing it properly.
  - Use the imperative mood
  - Write short messages (under 50 characters usually, under 75 for the full line with commitlint)
  - Do not end it with a period
  - Think of what changes if the commit is merged/accepted in an upstream branch

You can use the package [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) to check if your commit
messages respect the standard rules, or, just as I usually do, extend the
[conventional config](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/@commitlint/config-conventional)
with your own scopes and types.

## Let's start practicing

Let's put the above into action. First, install the below packages.

?> In all shell blocks below, the "$" (dollar) symbol stands for a prompt.

```bash showLineNumbers
npm i -D @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional
npm i -D lint-staged husky prettier
```

I personally use the below commitlint configuration.

```js title=".commitlintrc.cjs" showLineNumbers
module.exports = {
  extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional'],
  rules: {
    'scope-enum': [
      2,
      'always',
      [
        "style", "lint", "review", "uiux", "deps", "build",
        "release", "flags", "logs", "db", "security", "perf",
        "a11y", "i18n", "typos", "literals", "analytics",
        "seo", "linux", "windows", "osx", "android", "ios"
      ],
    ],
    'type-enum': [
      2,
      'always',
      [
        'wip', 'feat', 'fix', 'config', 'refactor', 'revert',
        'chore', 'ci', 'assets', 'test', 'docs', 'init'
      ],
    ],
  },
}
```

### Hooks, but not React hooks

Many projects have various code checking or linting tasks, and mine are no different. I always add a prettier configuration
such as the `.prettierrc` below and hook in the pre-commit step using [Husky 🐶](https://github.com/typicode/husky).

```json title=".prettierrc" showLineNumbers
{
  "printWidth": 120,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "useTabs": false,
  "semi": false,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "trailingComma": "all",
  "endOfLine": "lf"
}
```

It can be a pain to run some tasks on the complete codebase, so we can use [lint-staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged)
in order to check only the files staged since the last commit. You can see below, my only task is linting (and
fixing errors) with prettier, on _JavaScript-like_ files.

```json title="package.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": [
      "prettier --staged --write"
    ]
  }
}
```

Now we only need to set up husky and its [commit hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks):

- on **pre-commit** we will run lint-staged which will use out `package.json` configuration and trigger prettier
- we will use commitlint on our **commit message**

```bash showLineNumbers
npm set-script prepare "husky install" && npm run prepare
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npx lint-staged"
npx husky add .husky/commit-msg "npx commitlint --config .commitlintrc.cjs --edit"
```

### Semantic versioning

If you are unfamiliar with [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), it's a way of numbering releases for packages.
Dependency hell is a thing, and if you haven't had dependency version conflicts in your `package.json` until now, you
have just been lucky. Even though [semantic-release](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semantic-release) is the most popular
release automation package out there, as I rarely end up in the position of needing to release a package (only internal
ones until now), I choose [standard-version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/standard-version) which is:

- simpler
- autogenerates a `CHANGELOG.md` file on releases based on your conventional commit messages
- bumps package **version number** and creates git **tags**

Install it and add the **npm script** for quick access.

```bash showLineNumbers
npm i -D standard-version
```

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    //...
    "release": "standard-version --no-verify --sign"
  }
}
```

## Be a commit citizen!

Of course, semantic commits are cool, but learning a new syntax is so hard when you just want commit and go home at the
end of the day (PS: never push to production at the end of the day. **NEVER**) That's where [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)
comes into place, giving you a cli tool that can hook into git and ask you every part of the commit that you need to
introduce. Of course, once cgain, everything is customizable, to match your commit convention. You can even skip
questions!.

The best part is that you can add emoji into commit messages! GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket support a range of
[standard emoji code](https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/) and some famous tools like [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/)
stand for adding emoji in commit messages to make them, once again, easier to follow (yes, that's the purpose of tags,
but an image is worth a thousand words, so an emoji about 1 word). To combine that with commitizen, just add the
[cz-emoji](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cz-emoji) adapter and it will add an emoji code at the beggining of your
descriptions. Install both packages globally with npm, and you will now be able to run `git cz` to run the **CLI**.

```bash showLineNumbers
npm i -g commitizen cz-emoji
touch ~/.czrc
```

### What's your type?

Before you get to see my `commitizen` configuration, I need to finally exaplain my choice of types and scopes. The most
basic types are the commitlint defaults, which follow the
[Angular convention for commit types](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/@commitlint/config-conventional#type-enum).
However, that can become bothersome as some tags are overlapping (`build` and `ci` seem to me more of the same while
you can have different other types of tasks associate with the build systems - refactoring, chores, configs) and some
essential ones are missing (how could you lack a work-in-progress tag `wip` for a fast iteration project is unthinkable).
More than that, the **gitmoji** choice of associations creates an even longer list of possibilities (as they became
cz-emoji defaults). Specifically:

- having a type for `windows` doesn't explain that you did a fix, feature or configuration, so it should better be a scope
- having 4 different `dependency` tags is just polluting the namespace.

I have tried getting my own list and, after a few iterations, I end up with the below scopes and types, both ordered
mostly by frequency of use.

```json title=".czrc" showLineNumbers
{
  "path": "cz-emoji",
  "config": {
    "cz-emoji": {
      "conventional": true,
      "skipQuestions": [
        "issues"
      ],
      "symbol": false,
      "scopes": [
        "style", "lint", "review", "uiux", "deps", "build",
        "release", "flags", "logs", "db", "security", "perf",
        "a11y", "i18n", "typos", "literals", "analytics",
        "seo", "linux", "windows", "osx", "android", "ios"
      ],
      "types": [
        {
          "emoji": "🚧",

        },
        {

          "code": ":rewind:",
          "description": "Reverting changes.",
          "name": "revert"
        },
        {
          "emoji": "🔩",
          "code": ":nut_and_bolt:",
          "description": "Doing a chore.",
          "name": "chore"
        },
        {
          "emoji": "👷",
          "code": ":construction_worker:",
          "description": "Changing CI/build system.",
          "name": "ci"
        },
        {

          "code": ":bento:",
          "description": "Adding or updating assets.",

          "emoji": "📝",
          "code": ":pencil:",
          "description": "Writing docs.",
          "name": "docs"
        },
        {
          "emoji": "🎉",
          "code": ":tada:",
          "description": "Initial commit.",
          "name": "init"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

It's important to have a way of working with your projects properly, that you always rely on and guides you through the
administrative, non-coding part. Or at least that's what everyone thinks (and yours humble author with them).
