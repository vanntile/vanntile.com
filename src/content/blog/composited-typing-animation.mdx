import AnimatedHeader from '../../components/AnimatedHeader.astro'

This is how I turned an inefficient animation into a composited one, using Tailwind and CSS knowledge. I use the
animation on top of my homepage so it would have been hard for me to accept that a [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/)
is the top issue of my visitor's load. If it wasn't obvious (or I've changed my homepage since writing this post), the
animation is the one below.

<div class="mt-8 mb-16">
  <AnimatedHeader />
</div>

## The starting point

We all need to start somewhere, and this is where I have started. First of all, I am using
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) as a CSS framework in order to avoid reinventing the wheel whenever I need some
basic utility (and I can also rely on some beautiful patterns and dark mode out of the box). But it should be as
straightforward as some other code to somebody familiar with modern CSS and animations.

But first, requirements – the animation needs:

- to be timed properly
- to be able to have an emoji (that's because of my own copy)
- to be responsive (to look just as good on different screen sizes)

```html showLineNumbers
<header className="mb-16 group">
  <h1 className="mb-1 font-mono text-4xl text-gray-100 md:text-6xl">
    hi, I'm <br className="block md:hidden" />
    <span
      className="inline-flex h-20 pt-2 overflow-x-hidden animate-type group-hover:animate-type-reverse whitespace-nowrap text-brand-accent will-change-transform"
    >
      vanntile 👋
    </span>
    <span
      className="box-border inline-block w-1 h-10 ml-2 -mb-2 bg-white md:-mb-4 md:h-16 animate-cursor will-change-transform"
    ></span>
  </h1>
  <div className="text-xl font-semibold md:text-3xl">developer by choice and designer for fun</div>
</header>
```

The above `HTML` block tries to do lots of things in the same time. First of all, it promotes the span being animated on
its own layer using the `will-change-transform` class, included below. This has the effect of
[hinting the browser to optimise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/will-change) that element's paint
stage in the render cycle.

x> It's essential that we don't overdo it (you can but shouldn't promote everything as it takes processing power from
the browser's allowed CPU time).

```css showLineNumbers
.will-change-transform {
  will-change: transform;
}
```

Next, it has an `animate-type` class which sets an animation continuously, but that gets overriden by
`animate-type-reverse` when the container [group](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#group-hover)
is hovered. Both are custom animations written by myself and change small details like duration, timing, ease and
direction for a base set of keyframes, which you can see below. Yes, I went through a painstaking work of matching
keyframe percentages to element width in characters.

```js title="tailwind.config.js" showLineNumbers
module.exports = {
  // ...
  theme: {
    extend: {
      animation: {
        cursor: 'cursor .6s linear infinite alternate',
        type: 'type 1.8s ease-out .8s 1 normal both',
        'type-reverse': 'type 1.8s ease-out 0s infinite alternate-reverse both',
      },
      keyframes: {
        type: {
          '0%': { width: '0ch' },
          '5%, 10%': { width: '1ch' },
          '15%, 20%': { width: '2ch' },
          '25%, 30%': { width: '3ch' },
          '35%, 40%': { width: '4ch' },
          '45%, 50%': { width: '5ch' },
          '55%, 60%': { width: '6ch' },
          '65%, 70%': { width: '7ch' },
          '75%, 80%': { width: '8ch' },
          '85%, 90%': { width: '9ch' },
          '95%': { width: '10ch' },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

At the end of it all, there is a `span` element that is animated as a blinking cursor. For this, we'll animate the
opacity of it's after `pseudo-element`, with a linear timing and an alternate direction (back and forward).

```css showLineNumbers
.cursor::after {
  display: block;
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  width: 4px;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: #fff;
  animation: cursor 0.6s linear infinite alternate;
  will-change: opacity;
}

@keyframes cursor {
  0%,
  40% {
    opacity: 1;
  }

  60%,
  100% {
    opacity: 0;
  }
}
```

To recap, what we are doing for now is animating the width of an element with hidden overflow which both changes the
layout and moves the next element's position (the cursor). **To be read**: It's really bad. Why? Because it triggers
on all browsers all rendering steps - [layout, paint and composite](https://csstriggers.com/width) (which need to be
recalculated).

## The end result

After several iterations I have reached the following version. First, let's address the irrelevant, but necessary
changes: we're changing the single quote into a `&apos;` and the emoji is resized depending on the screen size.

```html showLineNumbers
<h1 className="mb-2 font-mono text-4xl text-gray-100 md:text-6xl">
  hi, I&apos;m <br className="block md:hidden" />
  <span className="relative">
    <span className="h-20 pt-2 overflow-x-hidden whitespace-nowrap text-brand-accent">
      vanntile <span className="text-3xl md:text-5xl">👋</span>
    </span>
    <span
      className="{`${styles.cursor} absolute -bottom-0 left-0 -top-1 inline-block bg-gray-900 w-full animate-type will-change`}"
    ></span>
  </span>
</h1>
```

Afterwards, the animation logic completely changed from animating the width and hiding the rest to animating the cursor
span only and translating it. Animating the [transform](https://csstriggers.com/transform) will trigger only compositing
on most browsers. In order to make our trick work we position it absolute from the relative parent and we make it full
width (while positioning it slightly over the top to cover our text completely). Of course, it wouldn't work if we
wouldn't it's display wouldn't be block, in order to have some width without content.

You can see in the snippet below the keyframes to the one and only animation (we have removed the complex logic that
would change on hover because sometimes it's better to _keep it simple, stupid_).

```js title="tailwind.config.js" showLineNumbers {6} caption="Final animation"
module.exports = {
  // ...
  theme: {
    extend: {
      animation: {
        type: 'type 2.7s ease-out .8s infinite alternate both',
      },
      keyframes: {
        type: {
          '0%': { transform: 'translateX(0ch)' },
          '5%, 10%': { transform: 'translateX(1ch)' },
          '15%, 20%': { transform: 'translateX(2ch)' },
          '25%, 30%': { transform: 'translateX(3ch)' },
          '35%, 40%': { transform: 'translateX(4ch)' },
          '45%, 50%': { transform: 'translateX(5ch)' },
          '55%, 60%': { transform: 'translateX(6ch)' },
          '65%, 70%': { transform: 'translateX(7ch)' },
          '75%, 80%': { transform: 'translateX(8ch)' },
          '85%, 90%': { transform: 'translateX(9ch)' },
          '95%, 100%': { transform: 'translateX(11ch)' },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## Conclusion

Our browsers are incredible bundles of code nowdays and we'd better spend some more time as developers to serve a
performant, non-wasteful experience to our user, which takes advantage of the optimisations our browsers can add to the
rudimentary rendering model we hold into our coding abstractions. And hey, don't forget to use Tailwind, it makes things
much easier!
