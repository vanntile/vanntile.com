!> The title underlines how things should be, what stated ideals specify, but not how it seems things are developing.

## TLDR

A recent EU plan mentions creating a solution for reading encrypted communication, reminding of ChatControl. Contact
your EU Parliament representative ([MEPs \| European Parliament][meps] and [Permanent representations][who-is-who]) and
ask they reject forcefully avoiding, breaking, or backdooring encryption for any reason, as it is a perilous endeavor
that nullifies privacy for all and brings significant risks for all EU citizens and residents. Most politicians are not
technically savvy, and they should be at least hearing the voice of their constituents.

## Not how protection looks like

The [ProtectEU][protect-eu] strategy report document published in April 2025 is a mega-proposal on all security (cyber
or otherwise) strategies intended to be proposed, researched and implemented in the next two calendar years (some
strategies covering effective applicability in August 2026 to 2029) in the European Union member states. The core scope
of the document is streamlining collaboration between various country-level agencies and Europol and creating a safe
infrastructure for fast response and data sharing to safeguard EU citizens, residents, and institutions against
individual and especially state actors.

This document includes potentially viable and useful proposals (along with the alphabet soup of bodies, comities, acts,
and institutions that should follow the report towards implementation in one form or another), some of which I
personally see as great initiatives. Notably, I support EU Digital Identity Wallets for all EU citizens and residents
(end of 2026), European Business Wallet (for cross-border interactions with public institutions), post-quantum
cryptography adoption for high-risk entities (I assume those at least include medical data), ensuring a *"common
framework for the handling of sensitive non-classified and classified information"* for institutions in the Union,
reducing the cybersecurity skills gap.

However, this is not a post about hopes, and dreams and I am not in any way an expert when it comes to public
administration and law enforcement collaboration as a private sector civilian (even though I try to be an informed
citizen). This post is about, as most of my in-person rants, plans to erode individual privacy and malicious attacks
on encryption. First, let's quote the core of the problem straight from the document:

> and the preparation of a Technology Roadmap on encryption, to identify and assess technological solutions that would
enable law enforcement authorities to access encrypted data in a lawful manner, safeguarding cybersecurity and
fundamental rights.

This sounds just as positive as most of the proposal, but reading it once more shows it has the same risk as the
ChatControl bill, which has been rejected again and again and has been spoken against by many aware cybersecurity
experts and privacy advocates. The problem that MEPs and their counselors still, after all this effort, do not (or
pretend or refuse to) understand is that there is no technical to break encryption and still call it encryption. I
will outline the arguments, without resources this one time, because my focus is somewhat different today.

Firstly, if the supposedly encrypted data includes law enforcement as a recipient (supposedly to stay encrypted), then
law enforcement (invariably connected to public infrastructure) becomes the biggest and most important non-financial
honeypot for hackers. Because this would be a collaborative effort, giving access to every state's agency, then not
only would this become the most sought-after target, it would also have numerous entry points. *Too many cooks spoil
the broth* et all.

Secondly, if the first assumption is false, then the overall security of every (personal) device of would be inherently
broken, with a backdoor that must provide complex functionality and would be broken into eventually, either through a
supply chain attack or a regular bug in any of its subsystems. Period. Over and over again, we have heard how MEPs,
public administration, police, and military personnel are themselves, like the rest of us civilians, just humans. Data
leaks from them about their official positions though personal communications (military bases locations, 40%+ of MEPs
with [breached emails][leaked-politicians] etc.). Even if technically the system would be full proof in isolation, add
the human element, and this would lower the barrier of entry on exfiltrating data from and about the exact targets they
would ideally most desire to protect (if hypocritically they would consider the privacy of an MEP, prime minister or
president more valuable than that of a non-elect citizen). There have also been rumors of this system not applying to
these official targets, but that would be unequal, unjust and, dare I say, totalitarian. We do not need (and should
always reject by any means) a well-defined class system. Wealth inequality is already doing much more harm than it
should have ever been allowed.

Finally, with such a system being functional, you create two threat scenarios, one that doesn't happen nowadays and
another which today is powered by and exclusively requires expensive, state-level spyware without a guaranteed success
rate. The first is the one I am most concerned about – being able to read "encrypted" data from private conversations
would be usable not only by lawful actors (secret services looking for a high-impact case, documenting child abuse for
conviction, judges and prosecutors – I will leave the ethics of this parenthesis as a homework for the reader), but by
everyone in its **administration**. Yes, you maybe fully trust a judge, but do you trust every police officer, every
system administrator, every software engineer who debugs or evaluates a system, who installs hardware, who does a
security assessment? Do you trust they won't abuse it, even once, for personal reasons? That the feelings, or worse,
their boredom won't wonder if a spouse is faithful, if their child is lying to them, if a friend is gossiping or
sharing their darkest secrets? You can say – yes, we will have some people to oversee the system's usage and complete
access logs. Who oversees the overseers? The SCP Ethics Committee? There will always be someone in a digital system
(outside a quorum/consensus/blockchain type, which is inherently public) who has the power to set the access rights,
who can change the logs, and even if they are the most insignificant person in the state apparatus, the admin, in the
end, has all the power. Do you trust that person? Or their summer replacement? Or the intern for their position? Their
correspondent in another city, county, country? What if part of this infrastructure is managed by a more
cost-efficient corporation and not a Union/state owned institution?

The second threat scenario involves governments. When a single country, even temporarily, through democratic processes,
turns against the values of the Union, and they decide to use their access to gain leverage against another – to push a
vote over the threshold, for profit, influence, or ideology – what will stop them? You can say that country A won't
have access to the data of residents of country B - but isn't the system meant to be at the Union level and not state
segregated? We have had several cases of state-level spyware in multiple European nations during the last decade, and
this project's intention would lower the costs and increase the chances of success of such projects (as there isn't
always a zero-day at hand). We already have misaligned countries and slow-to-align ones (I am thinking about my own),
and the tensions seem to be only rising currently.

Last time I checked, European citizens have not turned into ethical symbols following all rules and even stronger
principles where laws do not define the right action. More so, there is no perfect ethics in quite a number of
scenarios. We are all struggling on the road to betterment, but with no clear direction. Creating a surveillance
infrastructure comes with an even higher risk in the end, even if none of the above would apply – what happens if a
populist radical movement actively takes over the leadership position (democratically, as it happened already in
history) and decides that the previous criteria were too strict, and the legal principles are no longer needed? That's
why we cannot rely on humans to be able to see private data. We can much better rely on strict mathematical and
cryptographical properties. The only way encryption is secure is if it matches the highest security standards of the
time, making breaking encrypted communication feasible only one at a time and with matching resources.

purpose**.</span>

## Benevolent mistake

Without talking about individual politicians or states, let's accept the presumption of innocence and see how several
sections of this report include well-intentioned statements that actually support strengthening and not breaking
privacy.

> First, it sets the ambition of a change of culture on security. We need a whole-of-society approach involving all
citizens and stakeholders, including civil society, research, academia and private entities. The actions under the
strategy therefore take an integrated, multi-stakeholder approach wherever possible.

If you are willing to listen to academia, civil society, and other stakeholders, then ask any cybersecurity
professional or university department head how they call it when a third party silently listens in a supposedly
encrypted conversation.

> Security starts with effective anticipation.

I (and many others) anticipate that such a system will fundamentally damage trust and individual rights while making a
mockery of the branch of cybersecurity that guarantees (when implemented correctly) that there is even a chance your
bank account is not emptied every Thursday, that your personal pictures and videos are safe when you leave your laptop
at home, and that your neighbor isn't able to spy on all your devices just because your home access point is too loud.
If end-to-end encryption is outlawed, then only outlaws will use end-to-end encryption and then you will never catch
any of the crimes you anticipate.

> Systematic cooperation between law enforcement authorities and private parties, including service providers, is
therefore essential in future efforts to disrupt the most threatening criminal networks and individuals in the Union
and beyond.

There are so many more ways in which entities under the Digital Services Act (search engines, social media, video
sharing platforms) could cooperate to avoid substantial harm. An infrastructure for "safely" reading "encrypted"
communication would only divest resources and legal influence from those. Minor age verification, forbidding
monetization of minor attention, taking down live content which contains crime or gore material while announcing local
law enforcement, removal of a plethora of dark patterns which enable scams and phishing en masse for all ages. These
are all endeavors which require as much attention, and Big Tech will fight against the governing bodies just because
allowing them is not counted as a cost to society, but as a profit to the companies.

> Such access frameworks must also respect fundamental rights, ensuring inter alia that privacy and personal data are
adequately protected.

Agreed. Practice what you preach.

> Deploying post-quantum cryptography (PQC) solutions will be crucial to safeguard sensitive communications, data at
rest and to protecting digital identities in the new quantum era. […] the Commission is working with Member States to
foster that transition. In this regard, Member States should identify high-risk cases in critical entities and ensure
quantum-safe encryption for these high-risk cases as soon as possible and no later than by the end of 2030.

I have seen public reactions to the effort of adopting PQC while adding encryption backdoors as "wanting a metal gate
one can walk around". While it is a hilarious way of looking at the problem due to the hypocrisy it underscores, I need
to reiterate that PQC is, at least at the start, pushed to be used as soon as possible for critical entities (read as:
military, medical, public infrastructure), and not personal communication.

## End of the line

I don't have any final inspirational phrase for you, the reader. What I wrote was in good conscience, avoiding pointing
fingers and bringing evidence for individual desire for potential abuse. This is an important issue, so if you're also
an EU citizen, I ask you to take action as I describe at the beginning of this rant.
